### Summary Takeaway
- **Standard Mode** gives everything a blue-collar worker or small crew needs to communicate reliably, track time, and do basic jobs — resilient even in disasters, at very low cost.
- **Hybrid Mode** adds the **invaluable** AI layer that acts like a smart supervisor: critiquing work, translating, calling trade tools automatically, and preventing problems before they happen. This is where the real time/money savings and competitive edge come from.
- Nothing is “not needed” in the sense of bloat — every feature serves a real field use case — but the advanced AI and analytics become truly **invaluable** once you manage crews or scale to enterprise/nation levels.

| **Not Needed / Overkill** | Per-message billing | Never | — | — | Explicitly avoided – against ethical rule. |
| **Not Needed / Overkill** | Separate “pack” purchases for trades | Never | — | — | Occupational tools are invisible & included – no upsell friction. |
| **Not Needed / Overkill** | Residential-focused marketing/sales tools (e.g., lead gen, review requests) | Not applicable | — | — | Smith targets commercial trades, public-sector, and field coordination – not homeowner sales. |

**Summary of Value Tiers**  
- **Standard** = Expected features you’d find in most FSM/workforce apps (good but not unique).  
- **Invaluable** = Differentiators that save real time/money, reduce errors, or enable resilience (mesh, adaptive trade tools, deep AI supervisor). These are what make Smith potentially disruptive.  

This table keeps the app lean, ethical, and powerfully focused on blue-collar coordination at any scale.
