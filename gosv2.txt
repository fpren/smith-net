The pattern is refined; which trades first is sequencing, not a feature question.                       |
| 17 | Time & Presence                   | **GPS / Geofence Clock-In & Clock-Out**               | Solo, Foreman, Enterprise         | Auto clock-in/out when arriving/leaving job sites; used by both solo and crews.                                                                                                                           |

Internal logic to aggressively drop per-head cost as headcount rises; 3-6-9 is treated as financial code, not UI.                                                                     |

| 36 | Reporting                         | **Project-Level AI Supervisor Reports**               | Foreman, Enterprise               | Aggregated, human-readable project summaries for invoices, audits, and client transparency. Both standard and advanced invoice flows rely on this.                                                        |

### Direct answer to your question

* **Yes:** This table represents all the **refined, committed features** we have so far: roles, mesh, chat, AI behavior, forms, invoices (standard + advanced), paystubs, auto-quoting, disaster philosophy, LLM/vendor strategy, and pricing logic.
* Anything we discussed that is **not captured here** should be treated as **idea / backlog**, not part of the current spec.

If you want, the next move is to decide:

1. which of these are **v1 launch-critical**, and
2. which can be **post-launch** without breaking the architecture.
